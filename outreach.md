## Current Outreach

### Expanding Your Horizons Chicago

[Expanding Your Horizons Chicago](https://eyhchicago.com/) holds one-day conferences for middle school-aged girls to learn about STEM careers through volunteer-led, hands-on workshops. As a member of the EYH Chicago Organizing Committee and the Volunteers Committee (2021-present), I assist in recruiting, training, and managing volunteers for EYH events.

### UChicago Department of Human Genetics
As a student representative for the Department of Human Genetics, I have contributed to the planning of graduate student recruitment events as well as social events for current students. Additionally, I am a part of a team organizing computational biology and coding workshops for Chicago-area high school and middle school students.

## Past Outreach

### The GW Undergraduate Review

As an undergraduate student at The George Washington University, I founded the
[GW Undergraduate Review (GWUR)](http://www.gwur.org/), GW’s first university-wide undergraduate research
journal. GWUR is entirely student-run and supported by the office of the Vice President for Research (OVPR). The inaugural edition was pulbished in April
of 2018. Serving as Editor for the first two volumes, I worked with a 30-student team to
develop and implement GWUR’s peer-review and publication processes. During my time as Editor, GWUR also
worked to promote education in science communication by launching an online SciComm
publication, the GW Scope, and holding a campus-wide event on the topic with speakers
from National Geographic and the Smithsonian Institution.

Another goal of GWUR is to give back to the academic community through outreach. As
Editor, I spearheaded several initiatives for the support and promotion of
undergraduate research opportunities including organizing an undergraduate oral presentation
competition at GW Research Days, facilitating workshops with GW Libraries on research-related
skills targeted to undergraduate students, and promoting our journal release events. The GWUR team has additionally worked OVPR to develop university-wide initiatives
for undergraduate research, including the successful development of an online research opportunities database, [GW Research Commons](https://students.researchcommons.gwu.edu/hub).

### Science Fair Volunteering

I have volunteered as a judge in the Education for Tomorrow Allicance's [SCI://TECH Exposition](https://www.efta-us.org/scitech-exposition.html) Science Fair and Technical Writing competition in 2021 and 2022. 

### The GW Association for Women in Mathematics

From 2017-2019, I served as Vice President and later President of the GW chapter of the [Association for Women in Mathematics](https://awm-math.org/).


### Pi Mu Epsilon, DC Gamma Chapter

From 2019-2020, I served as Secretary for the GW chapter of [Pi Mu Epsilon](https://pme-math.org/), a national mathematics honors society.
