Welcome to my blog! This is a personal project of mine that is motivated by several goals:

* Providing accessible summaries of my work, and that of others, in the fields of human & population genetics (+ practicing my SciComm skills!)
* Sharing about my experiences in early science career stages, such as undergraduate research (a particular passion of mine), fellowship applications, and graduate school 
* Providing useful resources for other students & scientists

I'm looking forward to using this outlet to write about my research, activities as an early-career scientist and grad student, and other science and science-adjacent topics. Stay tuned for more!
