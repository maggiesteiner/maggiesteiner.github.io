# Research

I am currently a member of the [Novembre Lab](jnpopgen.org) at UChicago. I am interested in studying spatial processes in evolution and impacts on human disease traits. My current research focuses on the impact of geographic sampling and dispersal on rare variant ascertainment and models for the spatial spread of adaptive alleles. 

I previously worked in the areas of retroviral evolution and bioinformatics as a research assistant in the [GW Computational Biology Institute](https://cbi.gwu.edu/). I also completed research internships at the following institutions as an undergraduate student: [Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center Department of Biostatistics (QSURE Fellowship)](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/quantitative-sciences-summer-undergraduate-research-experience-qsure), [UTHealth School of Public Health Dept. of Biostatistics (CPRIT Fellowship)](https://sph.uth.edu/research/opportunities/cprit-undergraduate/), and [University of Pennsylvania Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/).

<em>More info coming soon!</em> In the meantime, all publications are listed on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=g0daNV8AAAAJ&hl=en) and [ORCID](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-1062-1228).
